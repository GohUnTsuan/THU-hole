Ms. Duan hasn’t been heard from since.\n\nWSJ NEWSLETTER\n\nNotes on the News\nThe news of the week in context, with Tyler Blint-Welsh.\nNotes on the News\nI would also like to receive updates and special offers from Dow Jones and affiliates.

By now, I realize that it’s owned by ‘red bloodlines,’” Mr. Shum said in an interview, referring to families of the party’s revolutionary elders. China’s wealthy entrepreneurs, he said, “are like super salarymen,” working on behalf of the true owners of the country, the revolutionary elite.\n\nIn his book, 52-year-old Mr. Shum recounts his relationship with his ex-wife and the couple’s business dealings since the early 2000s, delving into an earlier era of Chinese politics when members of the party elite and entrepreneurs often worked hand-in-glove on lucrative deals amid a nationwide, no-holds-barred scramble for riches.\n\nBut the couple’s experiences, according to Mr. Shum, also shed light on Mr. Xi’s escalating efforts to rein in private business and redirect entrepreneurial energies in service of the party’s priorities.\n\nDidi, Alibaba, Tencent: The Risks of Investing in Chinese Tech\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nUP NEXT\n\n\n0:00 / 4:58\nDidi, Alibaba, Tencent: The Risks of Investing in Chinese Tech\nDidi, Alibaba, Tencent: The Risks of Investing in Chinese Tech\nChinese tech stocks popular among U.S. investors have tumbled amid the country’s regulatory crackdown on technology firms.

Part of their holdings are held on behalf of the red owners at the back.”\n\nThe party’s anticorruption agency and the State Council Information Office, the government’s publicity arm, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Alibaba Group and the Jack Ma Foundation didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\nIn recent months, Mr. Xi has been championing “common prosperity,” a slogan that loosely signals the Communist Party’s intention to empower workers and the disadvantaged, limiting gains of the capitalist class when necessary to address social inequities.\n\nThe new policy direction is a major driver behind China’s recent regulatory actions against technology companies, including Mr. Ma’s Alibaba, and other businesses that Beijing views as contributing to social divides. Authorities most recently targeted the country’s online videogame industry, one of the largest in the world, in the name of protecting minors.\n\n“Alliances with businessmen were temporary as part of the Party’s goal of total societal control,” Mr. Shum writes in his book. “Once we were no longer needed—to build the economy, invest overseas, or help restrict freedoms in Hong Kong—we, too, would become the enemy.”\n\nIn pursuing “common prosperity,” Mr. Xi wants to safeguard Communist rule by addressing a widening rich-poor gap that could undermine the party’s legitimacy, Mr. Shum said in his interview.\n\nFrom the Archives\nChina’s Communist Party Turns 100, Looks to the Future\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nUP NEXT\n\n\n0:00 / 5:52\nChina’s Communist Party Turns 100, Looks to the Future\nChina’s Communist Party Turns 100, Looks to the Future\nAt the Chinese Communist Party’s centennial celebration, President Xi Jinping called for defiance against foreign pressure.
