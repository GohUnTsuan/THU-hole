The postponement did not reflect any substantive problem with the trade deal, the source said, adding: \"The new date has not been finalized yet.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday repeated his view that the trade deal was \"doing very well,\" but did not comment on the delayed meeting. The White House referred queries on the talks to Lighthizer's office, which did not respond to a Reuters query about plans for the review.\n\nAnother source familiar with the plans said that U.S. officials wanted more time to allow China to increase purchases of U.S. goods agreed in the deal, to improve the political optics of the review.\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/exclusive-us-china-trade-deal-review-planned-for-saturday-postponed-sources/ar-BB17Yflj", "timestamp": 1597460146, "type": "text", "updated_at": 1606782603, "url": "", "vote": {}}}
